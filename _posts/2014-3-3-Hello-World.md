###What did I do this past week?###


The first week of Object Oriented programming included a review of the course syllabus, an introduction to C++ and exposure to the Collatz Conjecture. On Wednesday after reviewing the syllabus and expectations for the class, Professor Downing went through a simple hello.c++ file, comparing each line to how it would be presented in java. This proved very helpful for students such as myself that aren’t familiar with C++, but have experience with java from our introductory courses. On Friday Professor Downing introduced us to the Collatz Conjecture and through that code exposed us to different ways of using assert statements to test code. 


###What's in my way?###


My obstacle for this week is to get used to the newness of the course. I’m fairly new to C++, however with Professor Downing’s presentation of the language in comparison to java, I’m sure I will be able to pick it up quickly. In addition, I need to familiarize myself and learn how to use the multiple tools we will use in the course for code development and testing.


###What will I do next week?###


This week will consist of the first set of readings and quizzes covering chapters from the textbook and outside papers. I hope to become familiar with the Docker environment and other tools Downing has given us.  


###My experience in this class###


So far I have had a pleasant experience in the class. I appreciate that Professor Downing is very clear in the way he lectures and is adamant about connecting the material to applications in the real world and not strictly in the scope of the class. Cold calling takes place in this class with can be somewhat intimidating, however it keeps me on my toes and attentive in class. I am eager to see how this class will strengthen not only my skills as a programmer, but also my career path.
